# REFT

REFT stands for Really Easy Food(/Fitness) Tracker. It logs the foods you eat by *category* instead of by *name*. This results in it being much faster to log foods.

For an example, if you had a slice of pizza, you could log it as 1 serving of bread, 1/2 serving of cheese and meat, and 1/4 serving of vegetables. This is easy to do in REFT, and takes about 5-10 seconds. 

It's built in Flask using Jinja2 templates and SQLalchemy.
